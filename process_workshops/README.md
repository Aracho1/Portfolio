## Process Workshop: Wednesday December 01, 2020

I attended my first process workshop at Makers. The general outline of the process workshop can be found [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/process_review).

The challenge I chose was [this](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/process_review/exercises/10_minute_walk). The goal was to write a simple program that returns true or false depending on if a walk takes exactly 10 minutes.

I followed the following process:

1) Plan how to solve the problem in a [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ri1VsNBj1PQ8u8DBjWNZ8bAtw_leNB1uISzcTBFbEm4/edit?usp=sharing)

2) Write the program in a [REPL](https://repl.it/@ACho1/ProcessWorkshop20201201)

3) Check that the program works in the intended way by testing with the given tests

4) Refactor

I recorded my process [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bTXagYLMUVCizd-Vw9qETMtmbTGSmeci/view?usp=sharing) (note there is no sound!)

## Key learnings from the workshop

**Good process**
- Solve the simplest problem first (carve out small pieces from the overall project)
- Follow a set of repeatable steps: plan -> test -> implement -> refactor
- Input / output table can be helpful
- Give sufficient time to planning 

**Note for next time**
- Do not record using Macbook function because it won't record the sound!
- Think about a problem I want to bring for the next workshop (instead of picking from the given list)
- Leverage the domain modelling template from the coach workshop
