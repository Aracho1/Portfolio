# Project: Simple Checkout

I worked on this project to progress on the following areas:
> "I know how my language works"  
> "I can build with objects"  
> "I can test-drive my code"

## Action Plan
I have written the code for a supermarket checkout that can calculate the price of a number of items. Each item should be priced individually, and the checkout should be able to scan them in any order.

The requirements for the system were as follows:

> As a shopper  
> So I know how much an item costs  
> I would like to be able to see its price

> As a shopper  
> So that I can buy an item  
> I would like to be able to scan items at the checkout

> As a shopper  
> So that I know how much to pay  
> I would like to be able to see a total for all scanned items

> As a shopper  
> So that I know how much to pay  
> I would like to see all prices correctly formatted (Â£xx.xx)

You main focus here should be to follow a rigorous TDD process: RED, GREEN, REFACTOR!

## Evidence
- I feel confident in explaining the approach I took to writing my code and justifying the decisions (emotional)
- I believe I have a well tested, working implementation of the system described above (empirical)
- I have discussed my approach with a coach, describing my TDD process, and received feedback (credible)

## Key Takeaways for Further Learning
- Understand the difference between output and return
- Get familiar with RSpec 'output' matcher
- Understand 'side effects' and how to manage them
- Look into accumulator and reduce methods as ways to minimise side effects
- Look into 'arrange, act and assert' process
- What does it mean to test 'behaviour'?
- Not necessary to test individual methods in isolation when they are in one Class
