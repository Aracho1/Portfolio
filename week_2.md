### Coach feedback on weekend challenge ([airport challenge](https://github.com/Aracho1/airport_challenge))

```
Overall, this is a really good airport challenge. You did many things well:

- Adding feature tests
- Good separation of classes
- Really good organisation of tests and bearing reusability in mind

Things to look at to improve (goals for the week):
- Write Unit Tests that are isolated
- Testing Behaviour and not State
- Defining your public interface for each class and making private the elements that should be private
```

### Workshop on Domain model diagramming
**Key takeaways**

Domain modelling [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J1HhScM5-4rzqWL8SylgQBnl6fg6KPlFakflxbeNvsc/edit?usp=sharing)

1. Highlight nounes (classes) and actions (as opposed to 'verbs') e.g. "count how many students are signed in" as action

2. Investigate user stories: 
- nouns -> property or owner of property
- actions -> owned by?
- actions -> property it reads / changes

3. class diagrams: class(owners), properties(instance variables), actions(methods)
